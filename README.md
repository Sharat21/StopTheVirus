How the Game works
____________________

The main focus of the game is to stop the virus. The player is a vaccine which shoots life bullets, and the enemy is the virus which also shoots more virus bullets. The Player has to shoot all bullets and ensure no bullets hit the bottom of the screen or hit the actual player, otherwise the game ends. Once the player loses the score is recorded as well as the highest score on each attempt. The game also has buttons to take the user to the main game screen, the home page as well as the game over screen.

Future Plans
_________________________
We hope to potentially add a feature to allow players to choose their player skin to play with, as well as a setting/options feature to allow the player to change their setting or keybinds as they wish. We also are working to implement levels to make the game harder, as well as hope to make the game run smoother,
